# Basic requirements for CI/CD scripts
# These are minimal dependencies for the scoring and automation scripts

# No external dependencies required for the scoring script
# It uses only Python standard library modules:
# - json
# - os
# - xml.etree.ElementTree
# - datetime
# - glob
# - sys
# - pathlib
# - typing

# If additional functionality is needed in the future, add dependencies here
