# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Ghostworks is a production-grade, AI-native multi-tenant SaaS platform that demonstrates autonomous development capabilities. The system implements itself from specifications and passes comprehensive testing gauntlets. It features a modern monorepo architecture with Next.js frontend, FastAPI backend, Celery workers, and full observability stack. The platform serves as a showcase for AI-driven development workflows while providing a functional artifact catalog service.

2. WHEN testing standards are defined THEN the system SHALL specify coverage targets and test types
3. WHEN code conventions are established THEN the system SHALL define naming, structure, and import rules
4. WHEN deployment workflows are documented THEN the system SHALL ensure dev/stage/prod parity
5. WHEN file matching is configured THEN the system SHALL apply context-specific steering rules

### Requirement 5: Observability and Monitoring

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want comprehensive observability with metrics, logs, and traces, so that I can monitor system health and performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN OpenTelemetry is configured THEN the system SHALL export traces from api and worker services
2. WHEN Prometheus metrics are exposed THEN the system SHALL provide /metrics endpoints with golden signals
3. WHEN Grafana dashboards are created THEN the system SHALL display latency, error rate, and throughput metrics
4. WHEN structured logging is implemented THEN the system SHALL provide searchable logs for CRUD and auth flows
5. WHEN alerts are configured THEN the system SHALL notify on latency, error rate, and saturation thresholds

### Requirement 6: Automated Testing and Quality Assurance

**User Story:** As a development team, I want comprehensive automated testing with quality gates, so that I can maintain high code quality and catch regressions early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are run THEN the system SHALL achieve >= 70% backend coverage and >= 60% web coverage
2. WHEN API tests are executed THEN the system SHALL validate contract compliance and integration points
3. WHEN e2e tests are run THEN the system SHALL verify critical user journeys with Playwright
4. WHEN performance tests are executed THEN the system SHALL achieve p95 API latency < 200ms locally
5. WHEN CI runs the gauntlet THEN the system SHALL emit kiro_score.json with pass rates and performance metrics

### Requirement 7: Security and Hardening

**User Story:** As a security-conscious organization, I want the platform to follow security best practices and undergo automated security testing, so that sensitive data remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

5. WHEN security scanning runs THEN the system SHALL execute ZAP baseline scans in CI

### Requirement 8: Automation and MCP Integration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want AI-powered automation through MCP servers and agent hooks, so that routine tasks are handled automatically with appropriate oversight.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN MCP servers are configured THEN the system SHALL integrate github and aws-docs with appropriate auto-approval settings
2. WHEN Asset Gardener hook is triggered THEN the system SHALL optimize images and generate responsive variants
