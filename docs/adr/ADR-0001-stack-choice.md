# ADR-0001: Technology Stack Choice

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Ghostworks is designed as a production-grade, AI-native multi-tenant SaaS platform that demonstrates autonomous development capabilities. The platform needs to support modern web development patterns, high performance, scalability, and comprehensive observability while maintaining developer productivity and code quality.

Key requirements for the technology stack:
- Modern, type-safe development experience
- High-performance API with async capabilities
- Robust database with multi-tenant support
- Excellent ecosystem and community support
- Production-ready tooling and deployment options
- Strong observability and monitoring capabilities

## Decision
We have chosen the following technology stack:

### Frontend: Next.js 14+ with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript for type safety
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling
- **State Management**: React Query (TanStack Query) for server state
- **Testing**: Playwright for E2E, Vitest for unit tests

### Backend: FastAPI with Python
- **Framework**: FastAPI for high-performance async API
- **Language**: Python 3.11+ with comprehensive type hints
- **Database ORM**: SQLAlchemy 2.0 with async support
- **Migrations**: Alembic for database schema management
- **Validation**: Pydantic v2 for request/response validation
- **Authentication**: JWT with secure cookie handling

### Database: PostgreSQL
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL 15+ for ACID compliance
- **Multi-tenancy**: Row-Level Security (RLS) for tenant isolation
- **Caching**: Redis for session storage and task queuing
- **Search**: PostgreSQL full-text search with GIN indexes

### Background Processing: Celery
- **Task Queue**: Celery with Redis broker
- **Worker Management**: Async task processing
- **Monitoring**: Flower for task monitoring (development)

## Alternatives Considered

### Frontend Alternatives
1. **React with Vite**
   - Pros: Faster build times, more flexibility
   - Cons: More configuration needed, no built-in SSR/SSG
   - Rejected: Next.js provides better SEO and performance out of the box

2. **Vue.js with Nuxt**
   - Pros: Excellent developer experience, good performance
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less TypeScript maturity
   - Rejected: React ecosystem is more mature for enterprise applications

3. **SvelteKit**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, smaller bundle sizes
   - Cons: Smaller ecosystem, less enterprise adoption
   - Rejected: Ecosystem not as mature for complex SaaS applications

### Backend Alternatives
1. **Node.js with Express/Fastify**
   - Pros: JavaScript everywhere, large ecosystem
   - Cons: Less mature async patterns, weaker typing
   - Rejected: Python's async capabilities and typing are superior

2. **Django REST Framework**
   - Pros: Mature ecosystem, excellent admin interface
   - Cons: Slower performance, more opinionated structure
   - Rejected: FastAPI provides better performance and modern async patterns

3. **Go with Gin/Echo**
   - Pros: Excellent performance, strong concurrency
   - Cons: More verbose, smaller ecosystem for web development
   - Rejected: Python ecosystem is richer for rapid development

4. **Rust with Axum/Actix**
   - Pros: Maximum performance, memory safety
   - Cons: Steep learning curve, longer development time
   - Rejected: Development velocity is more important than maximum performance

### Database Alternatives
1. **MySQL**
   - Pros: Wide adoption, good performance
   - Cons: Weaker JSON support, less advanced features
   - Rejected: PostgreSQL's JSON support and advanced features are superior

2. **MongoDB**
   - Pros: Flexible schema, good for rapid prototyping
   - Cons: Eventual consistency, complex multi-document transactions
   - Rejected: ACID compliance is critical for SaaS applications

3. **SQLite**
   - Pros: Simple deployment, excellent for development
   - Cons: Limited concurrency, no built-in replication
   - Rejected: Not suitable for multi-tenant production workloads

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences
1. **Developer Productivity**: TypeScript across the stack provides excellent IDE support and catches errors early
2. **Performance**: FastAPI provides excellent async performance, Next.js optimizes frontend delivery
3. **Type Safety**: End-to-end type safety from database to frontend reduces runtime errors
4. **Ecosystem Maturity**: All chosen technologies have mature ecosystems with extensive libraries
5. **Scalability**: PostgreSQL and FastAPI can handle significant load with proper optimization
6. **Observability**: Excellent tooling support for monitoring, logging, and tracing
7. **Multi-tenancy**: PostgreSQL RLS provides robust tenant isolation at the database level

### Negative Consequences
1. **Learning Curve**: Teams need expertise in both Python and TypeScript ecosystems
2. **Deployment Complexity**: Multiple services require orchestration (mitigated by Docker Compose)
3. **Memory Usage**: Python and Node.js can be memory-intensive compared to compiled languages
4. **Build Complexity**: Multiple build processes for different services

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Documentation**: Comprehensive setup and development guides
2. **Tooling**: Standardized development environment with Docker
3. **Testing**: Comprehensive test suites to catch integration issues
4. **Monitoring**: Extensive observability to identify performance bottlenecks
5. **Code Quality**: Strict linting and formatting rules across all services

## Implementation Notes
- All services use consistent logging and error handling patterns
- Shared TypeScript types between frontend and backend via packages/shared
- Database migrations are version-controlled and automated
- Development environment fully containerized for consistency
- CI/CD pipeline validates the entire stack integration
